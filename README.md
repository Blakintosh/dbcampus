# Pitstop (aka. dbcampus)
Archive of the CS261 Group 7 software engineering project (2022-23)

### How to use
Frontend and Backend work on different ports (which is different than the database one). To run the frontend go to src/frontend and run `npm run dev`. Open another terminal or shell and go to src/backend and run `go run main.go`. You should then go to `localhost:5137/auth/login` to start the website. Before that make sure to have postgresql and run pitstop.sql from src/backend/src/databases
